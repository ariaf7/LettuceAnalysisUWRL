    "# Mask Creating/Saving Code\n",
    "In order to run the analysis on the images, we need to create and save the binary masks associated with each image. There are three combined masks used to get as much accurate representation as possible. Two of the masks eliminate black, and one the brown (for dirt and surrounding tray). These masks will be used later in the `pcv.segment_image_series` function. Make sure to correctly substitute the directories for where ever you are receiving/saving. "
